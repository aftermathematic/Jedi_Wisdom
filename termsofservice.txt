Terms Of Service

1. Use of Service:
Our service provides daily messages of Jedi wisdom. These teachings are for personal enlightenment and should be used in the spirit of the Jedi – for knowledge and defense, never for attack.

2. User Conduct:
As a user, you are expected to uphold the Jedi principles of respect, peace, and compassion. Harassment, use of offensive language, or other disruptive behavior is inconsistent with the way of the Jedi and our service.

3. Intellectual Property:
The content provided by Jedi Wisdom Daily, including text, graphics, and logos, is our property or the property of our content suppliers and protected by international copyright laws. It is intended solely for personal, non-commercial use.

4. Disclaimer of Warranties:
Our service is provided "as is". While we strive to transmit the Jedi wisdom accurately, we make no guarantees regarding the completeness, reliability, or accuracy of the content.

5. Limitation of Liability:
In no event shall we be liable for any damages arising out of your use of Jedi Wisdom Daily. Your journey with us is at your own risk, much like a Padawan’s path to becoming a Jedi.

6. Amendments to Terms:
These terms, like the Jedi Order, may evolve over time. We reserve the right to update and change these terms, and your continued use of the service constitutes acceptance of these changes.

May the Force guide you in your journey through our service.
