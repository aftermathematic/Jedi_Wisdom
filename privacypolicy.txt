Preamble:
In the spirit of the Jedi, whose wisdom we share daily, we, the guardians of Jedi Wisdom Daily, commit to protecting your privacy with the same integrity and respect we have for the Force. This document elucidates our practices regarding the collection, use, and protection of your personal information.

1. Data Collection:
We gather only the essential data required to transmit the wisdom of the Jedi to you. This includes your email address for daily message delivery and, optionally, your name to personalize your experience.

2. Use of Information:
Your information serves a singular purpose: to bring you the daily teachings of the Jedi. We pledge not to use your data for any purpose other than delivering these messages of enlightenment and occasional updates about our service.

3. Data Sharing:
True to the Jediâ€™s ethos of trust and honor, we do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer your personal information to outside parties. Your data remains under the safeguard of our temple, accessible only by those who have sworn to uphold the Jedi Code.

4. Data Protection:
Employing methods as secure as the archives of the Jedi Temple, we ensure the protection of your information against unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction.

5. Cookies and Tracking:
Just as a Jedi senses the Force, our site may use cookies to enhance your experience. These are small files that aid in understanding your preferences and improving future visits, but they hold no personal information.

6. Your Consent:
By using our site, you consent to our privacy policy, just as a Padawan consents to the teachings of their Master.

Should we amend our practices, as the Jedi adapt to the changing Force, we will update this policy accordingly. Your continued use of our service signifies acceptance of these changes.

May the Force be with you, always.
